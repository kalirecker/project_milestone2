# Project Objective 
    # The problem I am trying to solve is to further understand etsy's listings elements, and where it can be improved. 
    # I am solving this problem by scraping specific listing information, converting it into a dataframe, and putting it into a SQL database to execute queries to give insights into etsy's website
# Job Description 
    # Booz Allen is a global consulting firm, who’s employees provide solutions for government
  organizations and businesses in a variety of different industries from defense to health to energy. I selected this job because I enjoy having variety and change in my life. I tend to get bored of doing the same thing over and over again and like to switch things up every once in a while. This consulting firm offers that to me, as it works on thousands of different projects all over the world in a wide array of subjects. The job opportunity also includes requirements that I am fulfilling or will be capable of fulfilling in the future. One of the things that particularly stood out to me in the title description, other than the requirement for proficiency in SQL, was that it places high importance on briefing techniques, methods and findings to a non-technical audience. This is a skill I believe I can perform very well. One of the things that I know I don’t want to do, is simply sit behind a computer desk all day. I want to be working with others on a team and this shows that there is a great opportunity to do so. This job will be a lot of data analytics, so a sample problem I can think of would be analyzing a set of data to find out for example, what products are getting the least amount of sales in what regions. Using SQL I would select the products, their locations, their prices and dates of sale and compile them all into one table, grouping them by product and location. Then I would order them, using the count function, by the highest to lowest amount of sales. By analyzing that data I would be able to determine which products were being sold the least and most in each location and compare that to the price and sales date.
    # This project is related to the job posting because data visualization is largly connected to the SQL queries I will be using to analyze the data, although etsy would most likely hire their own data visualization specialist rather than utilize a consulting firm, it is an example of something I may do if in this position
# Data 
    # Source: etsy 
    # Characteristics: Listing,when the product was made, the price of the listing, how many products are in stock of the listing 
# Notebooks 
    # collecting the data, converting to a dataframe and implement into the SQL database

# Future improvements 
    # seperating the listings who's prices are dependent on selections and personalizations made 
    # gathering more specific data that can narrow down my findings, ie. seller, type of good
